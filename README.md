Toggle relativenumber
=====================

Vim plugin to toggle between absolute and hybrid line numbers in Vim 7.4+. Inspired by Jeff Kreeftmeijer's [plugin](https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-numbertoggle).

Since Vim 7.4 introduced hybrid line numbers, turning off absolute numbers is no longer necessary or even desirable when turning on relative numbers.

At the moment, this is very much a work in progress. I hope to add additional logic to switch off relative numbers when focus is lost, and some simple cut and paste bash commands for easy installation with [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).
